        <para>Use the <see cref="F:Aspose.Recognition.RecognitionMode.Textbox" /> mode when the resulting document is not goining

            Paragraphs and texlines in the flow mode allow easy modification of text, but unupported

      <summary>
        <para>This mode is fast and good for maximally preserving original look of the PDF file, 
            but editability of the resulting document could be limited.</para>
        <para>Every visually grouped block of text int the original PDF file is converted into a textbox 
            in the resulting document. This achieves maximal resemblance of the output document to the original 
            PDF file. The output document will look good, but it will consist entirely of textboxes and it 
            could makes further editing of the document in Microsoft Word quite hard.</para>

            Full recognition mode, the engine performs grouping and multi-level analysis to restore
            the original document author's intent and produce a maximally editable document.
            The downside is that the output document might look different from the original PDF file.

            Provides methods to convert Adobe PDF (Portable Document Format) documents into
            editable OOXML, DOC, RTF, WordprocessingML, OpenDocument and HTML documents.
            </summary>
      <remarks>
        <para>The simplest method to convert a PDF document in a single step is to use
            the <see cref="M:Aspose.Recognition.PdfRecognizer.Convert(System.String,System.String)" />.</para>
        <para>To convert a PDF document into a word processing document, create a <see cref="T:Aspose.Recognition.PdfRecognizer" /> 
            object, load the PDF document using the <see cref="M:Aspose.Recognition.PdfRecognizer.Open(System.String)" /> method and then
            save to the desired format using the <see cref="M:Aspose.Recognition.PdfRecognizer.Save(System.String)" /> method.</para>
        <para>To monitor conversion progress you can attach an event handler to the 
            <see cref="E:Aspose.Recognition.PdfRecognizer.Progress" /> event.</para>
        <para>Two modes of operations are provided by <see cref="T:Aspose.Recognition.RecognitionMode" /> in order to set priority 
            either for document readability or text editability.
            </para>
        <para>A PDF document is good for viewing and printing, but there is sometimes a need to convert it back 
            into an editable (word processing) document. The problem with conversion is that PDF documents are 
            "fixed-layout" documents and consist of commands that describe positions of text and graphics on pages, 
            but they do not describe elements such as paragraphs, tables, headers/footers, sections and so on commonly 
            found in word processing documents. When you load a PDF document into <see cref="T:Aspose.Recognition.PdfRecognizer" />, 
            it executes a complex pattern recognition algorithm to infer the editable document structure from 
            the PDF commands. Once recognition is complete, you can save the resulting word processing document 
            in a number of popular document formats.</para>
